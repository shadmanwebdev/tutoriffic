=================================================
Requests / Bookings
=================================================
When showing messages between
two users (`from_id`, `to_id`) 
we also need to show requests between them
(`student_id`, `tutor_id`)

1. Displayed chronologically. 
2. Requests can be updated 
3. Chronology for the requests will be 
created_at if updated_at is null
4. Chronology for the requests will be 
updated at if it is present
5. Chronology for messages is created_at
6. Requests must be shown in a 
chronological order in between the messages

We get messages and requests separately.
Afterwards using php order them chronologically. 

If the array item is a message we add an extra 
key/value pair type/message. 

If it's request key/value pair type/request. 
When displaying check if the type of the item is 
a message or a request first.



Actions after creating a request
1. Cancel/Reject (Both students and tutors)
2. Modify (Both students and tutors)
3. Accept (User that recieved the request)


Schedule / Modify
1. Modifying schedule creates a new request
without updating/deleting the old one.
2. Modified request has same 
ad_id, student_id, tutor_id
3. Modified request may have different
request_created_by

When modifying a request
we save the updated datetimes into js session


If submits after updating 
1. Insert the new datetime for the new request
