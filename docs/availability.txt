This is the availability

-> Tutor fills in the availability calendar
in their account panel
    1. Display availability calendar 
    with previously selected dates from database.

    These could be either
        a. dates saved in the database
        b. dates user has just selected but haven't submitted
        for update yet

    Ideally we'd get all the dates and times when loading the 
    calendar and save them into a session

    1. Selects date
    2. Fetch request sent to:   
        get-times-popup.php

        We get the previously selected times for this date

        If this date has previously selected time slots 
        then we display these time slots as highlighted
        and with the selected class (such as `merchant-time-selected`)

    3. Selects from time slots
    4. Clicks 
        a. Cancel (doesn't save + closes pop up)
        b. Save (saves new time slots)
    

-> Student sees the availability calendar
when they enter the tutor profile

-> Student selects from the availabile 
dates and times


Developer steps:
1. Log in to the tutor account
2. Create the availability calendar
    -> availability.php
    -> set-availability-calendar.php
