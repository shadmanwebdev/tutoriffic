    Modifications for messaging variant 2
======================================================
Get rid of following functions
    create_message_admin()
    get_user_list_admin()
    createForm()


Alter functions:
    1. No need to create different size variants for images in create_message()
    2. Change all the queries and column names
    3. Instead of getting associated videos or associated images we get
    associated files
    4. hasIndividualMessage() could simply change to has message
    as the first message will be sent as a request what we can do is have it
    as a request but also create a message that'll be shown in messaging
    5. We don't need functions under IMAGE & VIDEOS. Instead these will be
    functions that can upload/insert files/filenames and delete them

Remove tables columns:
    1. msgs:
        msg_for, price, price, msg_access, countdown




1. No images or videos. Instead attach downloadable files
2. We don't need to check countdowns
3. We don't need to check if message is paid or not
4. No sending bulk messages
5. Show requests/scheduling in messages
or
create the first message as a request
6. No access/membership levels


======================================================
    Key Features
======================================================
1. Messaging:
Divided into 2 main parts
    a. Chatting with an individual user
    b. Sending messages based on membership level

2. Access to messages
Based on subscription
    a. Messages individual users can see
    b. Messages everyone can see
    c. Messages only subscribers can see
Based on payment
    a. Free messages
    b. Pay to unlock messages

3. Countdown
Messages that have a countdown timer set.
Are visible only once the countdown ends.
If it's a paid message the 'Pay to unlock' button is visible
after countdown ends.



======================================================
    Data Flow
======================================================
User logs in and goes to messages page

-> Views a list of users (alter the order in which the list is shown)
    -> display_user_list('msg_id', 'ASC', null, $currentUserId)
        -> get_user_list()
        or
        -> get_user_list_admin()

-> Clicks on a user name. This sends an ajax request to the 'user-msg.php'
with the selected user's id

-> This calls the function 'display_user_messages()'
inside the 'DirectMessage' class

-> Inside display_user_messages() it calls following functions
    -> get_messages_for_user()
    -> message()
        -> get_msg_by_id()
    Here's how the code works inside 'message()'
    1. Get the message
    2. Store number of images and videos in variables
    3. Turn the text content into paragraphs
    4. If number of videos is more than 0 add these to the string
    5. If number of images is more than 0 add these to the string
    6. Check if the message has a countdown set

    7. If it does check 
    -> If it is paid or free
    -> If the countdown is finished or not
    -> if the person viewing it is admin or not

    8. If countdown is finished 
    and message is a paid message
    and person viewing it is not admin
    show the pay to unlock button

    9. If has no countdown check
    -> If it is paid or free
    -> if the person viewing it is admin or not
